# Constraints file for deterministic dependency resolution
# Use with: pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
#
# These pins ensure sentence-transformers (and its torch/transformers deps)
# resolve to known-working versions. sentence-transformers==3.3.1 is tested
# with these specific versions.

# PyTorch - pin to 2.x LTS for CUDA compatibility
# Note: If using CUDA, ensure your CUDA version is compatible
torch>=2.0.0,<2.5.0

# Transformers - pin to version tested with sentence-transformers 3.3.1
transformers>=4.36.0,<4.50.0

# Tokenizers - often breaks between minor versions
tokenizers>=0.15.0,<0.22.0

# Hugging Face Hub - required by transformers
huggingface-hub>=0.20.0,<0.27.0
